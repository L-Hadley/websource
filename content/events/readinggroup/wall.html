We will discuss this paper. The abstract is:
<blockquote>
ABSTRACT Modeling spatial interactions that arise in spatially
referenced data is commonly done by incorporating the spatial
dependence into the covariance structure either explicitly or
implicitly via an autoregressive model. In the case of lattice
(regional summary) data, two common autoregressive models used are the
conditional autoregressive model (CAR) and the simultaneously
autoregressive model (SAR). Both of these models produce spatial
dependence in the covariance structure as a function of a neighbor
matrix W and often a fixed unknown spatial correlation parameter. This
paper examines in detail the correlation structures implied by these
models as applied to an irregular lattice in an attempt to demonstrate
their many counterintuitive or impractical results. A data example is
used for illustration where US statewide average SAT verbal scores are
modeled and examined for spatial structure using different spatial
models.
