<p>
Partial likelihood methods  allow spatio-temporal models to be fitted
to point data without the need for computationally demanding Monte Carlo
methods. They can be applied to any model that specifies the intensity of
future  events conditional on the pattern of past events. This occurs 
naturally in such diverse areas as infectious disease models or patterns 
of birds choosing nest locations on a finite habitat.
