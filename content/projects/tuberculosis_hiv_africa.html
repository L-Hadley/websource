<p>
We are constructing spatial models to investigate the geographic
distribution of Tuberculosis, HIV and risk factors in communities in
Zambia, South Africa and Malawi. These models will be used to inform
care and control strategies in high incidence settings. This project
is a collaboration with researchers at the London School of Hygiene
and Tropical Medicine.
