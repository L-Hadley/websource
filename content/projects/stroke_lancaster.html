Jo Knight, Peter Diggle and Data Science MSc students Frances Biggin
and Eleanor Hudson are collaborating with Matt Heys of the Royal Lancaster Infirmary.

  They
are using hospital and GP data to look at patterns of stroke in
relation to a number of factors including rural or urban address. In
addition they are using statistical modelling to predict the number of
patients coming into Accident and Emergency departments.
