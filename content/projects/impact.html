  Immunotherapy helps the immune system (which protects the body
  against infection, illness and disease) to recognise and kill some
  types of cancer cells. We understand how immunotherapy works but
  very limited attention has been given to understanding the variable
  responses experienced by cancer patients receiving immunotherapy in
  the real-world setting. People with advanced cancer typically are
  helped by referral to palliative care services, with benefits seen
  in pain, symptoms and managing the stress of serious
  illness. However, those receiving immunotherapy may not be referred
  at the right time because of different expectations about a response
  to these new treatments. If we understand more about how these
  patients receiving immunotherapy respond or decline over time we
  will be able to target referrals better and improve communication
  about what patients can expect. This project, in collaboration with
  Christie NHS trust will investigate the drivers of differences in
  experiences of receiving cancer treatment, and will inform North
  West, and possibly national, cancer care.
