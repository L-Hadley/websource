<p>
The Dynamic Health Altas is a health informatics-based research
project. It is a web application which we have developed to
display point or areal data in space and time. This enables
visualisation of the health landscape of a population as it changes
over time. For example, such visualisations could be of particular
interest to healthcare managers wishing to implement or monitor
interventions at a population level. We have made this software open
source so that it can be applied to wide range of data.  Initially
this project used the Salford NHS records to create a health atlas to
show the prevalence of chronic kidney disease in Salford. It
dynamically displayed the past and present health landscape for this
disease in each sub-region of Salford.
</p>
<p>
The Dynamic Health Altas
is now being applied to:
<ul>
  <li><b>Hazardous Prescribing in Salford</b>: The
Salford Medication Safety Dashboard (SMASH) is a web application which
allows NHS GPs, pharmacists and healthcare managers to view patients
who may be at risk due to hazardous prescribing. The Dynamic Health
Atlas will be used to visualise (map) the prevalence of hazard
prescribing at NHS GP surgeries across Salford (UK) and track how it
evolves through time.</li>
  <li><b>Dengue in Sri Lanka</b>: The Dynamic Health Atlas is being used to visualise the prevalence of
Dengue cases in each district from 2011 to the present day. This work is currently being
extended to predict the prevalence of Dengue in each district for several months into the
    future.
  </li>
</ul>

This project is funded by the <a href="https://www.mrc.ac.uk/">Medical Research Council</a> 
and is a collaboration with <a href="https://www.research.manchester.ac.uk/portal/niels.peek.html">Niels Peek</a>
of Manchester University.
