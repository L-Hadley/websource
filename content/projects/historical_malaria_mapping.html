Together with Prof. Abdisalan Noor and Prof. Robert Snow from the
Kenya Medical Research Institute (KEMRI) in Nairobi, Kenya, we are
investigating the spatio-temporal trends of malaria in Africa over a
period of 100 years. The study is based on data from multiple
prevalence surveys conducted in malaria-endemic African countries from
1915 to 2014. The statistical analysis of the data presents many
challenges, such as variation in data-quality and temporal
sparsity. We are developing novel geostatistical methods that can make
the best possible use of the data whilst accounting for the main
sources of spatio-temporal variation.

The project is supported by an MRC Fellowship in Biostatistics awarded
to Emanuele Giorgi. One of the outputs of the project will be the
delivery of an interactive web-based animation showing the predicted
malaria prevalence, with other relevant summaries, across Africa.
