Jo Knight is on the International Consortium for Blood Pressure 1000 Genome
Analysis group. The consortium have undertaken a meta analysis on more
than 150,000 samples and identified new genetic risk loci for elevated
blood pressure. They have also used gene expression data to provide
further evidence of the functional involvement of the genes.
