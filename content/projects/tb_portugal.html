Being the second deadliest infectious disease worldwide, Tuberculosis (TB) is a global public 
health concern. Portugal, a medium-low level endemic country, has one of the highest 
European Union Tuberculosis incidence rates. Although the incidence of Tubuerculosis in 
Portugal has shown a recent declining trend, the heterogeneity in both regional endemics 
and their evolution through time suggests that a deeper understanding of the 
spatiotemporal pattern of cases is needed. We are using information from the National 
Tuberculosis Surveillance System â€“ General Directorate of Health - Ministry of Health 
(notified cases of PTB, annually), based on an agreement with the National School of Public 
Health, University Nova of Lisbon.

Our research in this area concentrates on two main objectives: 
<ul>
<li>Spatiotemporal modelling of success of treatment outcome, considering individual 
characteristics (socio-demographics, risk factors and associated pathologies) and 
ecological characteristics (environmental and contextual characteristics)
</li>
<li>
Spatiotemporal survival analyses focussing on delay to diagnosis (time between 
symptoms and diagnosis), adjusting for individual characteristics (socio-
demographics, risk factors and associated pathologies) and ecological characteristics 
(environmental and contextual characteristics)
</li>
</ul>
