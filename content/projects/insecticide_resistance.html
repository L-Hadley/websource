<p>
In the last 15 years 260 million clinical cases of malaria have been
prevented in Sub Saharan Africa, overwhelmingly through the use of
insecticides that target the mosquito vector.  Insecticide resistance
is therefore a major threat to the sustained control of malaria. Whole
genome sequencing of malaria mosquitoes has the power to revolutionise
our understanding of the evolution of insecticide resistance; allowing
us to design new insecticides and to develop strategies that delay the
onset of resistance. However genomic technologies will only reach
their full potential with improved sampling design and when extensive
individual and population level metadata (collection location,
infection/ disease state etc) accompany each sequenced sample.

<p>
Within this project, CHICAS will support the development of spatially-
and temporally- explicit sampling frameworks for malaria vectors to
permit local-scale genetic tracking and prediction of (i) population
connectivity, (ii) temporal stability and (iii) insecticide
resistance.

This is a Â£500000 MRC-led Foundation Award, with support from BBSRC,
led by Prof Martin Donnelly of the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine
and starting the 1st of April 2017 for 2 years.
