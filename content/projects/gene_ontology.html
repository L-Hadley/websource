<p>
Gene ontology is a structured language holding information about the
function of a gene. Jo Knight, 
<a href="http://www.douglas.qc.ca/researcher/mallar-chakravarty?locale=en">Dr Mallar Chakravarty</a> (
Computational Neuroscientist, Brain Imaging Centre, Douglas Institute)
and 
graduate student Sejal Patel 
have developed a method to
identify a priority gene list based on the molecular function of
previously identified genes. All genetic data can then be analysed
controlling for false discovery rate in a stratified framework
potentially increasing the power to find a causal variant.
