<p>
Much remains unknown about how antibiotic resistance spreads globally,
which is particularly true in sub-Saharan Africa, where diagnostic
laboratories are not commonly available. DRUM will work
collaboratively within Uganda and Malawi to identify and understand
the key drivers of resistance.
</p><p>
The DRUM Consortium will address how human behaviour and antibacterial
usage in the home, around animals, and in the wider environment in
urban and rural areas of Uganda and Malawi contributes to the spread
of antibiotic resistance in bacteria.
</p><p>

DRUM seeks to develop agent-based models that will enable the
prediction of how these transmission pathways can be
interrupted. DRUM’s vision is to establish Ugandan and Malawian sites
as sustainable model settings for interdisciplinary study and
mitigation of AMR by embedding a One Health strategy at the heart of a
consortium that will generate outputs applicable to similar
communities throughout East and Southern Africa and beyond.
