In this project we have worked on the questions that will improve our
knowledge and understanding of the natural history of stroke in the
state of Kelantan, Malaysia. We posed questions to
subjects from the population of interest to reflect our results across
the greater Kelantan population to develop a model of risk
factors for stroke, models of case-fatalities and survival to compare
the characteristics and outcomes of two main types of stroke,
i.e. ischaemic stroke and haemorrhagic stroke, and lastly to assess
the longitudinal change in functional health status using the Barthel
Index post-stroke.

The project has produced four draft papers, in which several modelling
data collection and data analysis strategies were applied to four
data-sets: one was provided by the hospitals, two were extracted by us
and the final one was based on personal interviews with stroke
survivors. The new knowledge stemming from the stroke modelling and
outcome assessment developed and analysed in this thesis could help
improve our understanding of stroke in Kelantan. In conclusion, our
data and the four draft papers written based on this PhD project have
added new stroke data and knowledge on the progression of stroke,
which is understated in the Malaysian and Asian population in general
and in Kelantan specifically.
