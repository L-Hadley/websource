<p>
Alder Hey Children's Hospital's existing method for forecasting
admissions was based on admission counts in previous years - a bit
like trying to predict tomorrow's weather based on the weather a year
ago. We know it will be roughly right, but won't recognise that we
have "hot spells" or "cold spells" of weather away from the norm that
last a few days. Similarly, but for unknown reasons, admission numbers
show fluctuations away from the simple forecast model the hospital was
using.
</p>

<p>
We constructed a statistical forecasting system that uses the
historical data to get the average behaviour and modulates its
predictions based on recent data, producing forecasts that are more
accurate and have an associated measure of precision.
</p>

<p>
The daily predictions are delivered via an interactive web site
accessible to hospital staff only. You can view
the <a href="http://www.maths.lancs.ac.uk/~rowlings/Chicas/AlderHey/">demo site</a>
which uses simulated data only.
