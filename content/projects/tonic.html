<p>
TONiC is a national study examining the factors that influence quality
of life in patients with neurological conditions. The study is led by
the Walton Centre NHS Foundation Trust with collaborators across 35
specialist neurological centres in the UK. It is one of the largest
studies on quality of life in neurological conditions ever performed
in the UK.
</p>
<p>
The study will investigate more than 30 factors, including fatigue,
pain, depression and weakness, to create models which will be used as
tools to provide personalised care, increase efficiency and improve
patient forecasting.
