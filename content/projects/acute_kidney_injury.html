<p>
Acute kidney injury (AKI) corresponds to sudden falls of kidney
excretion function in a short time. It is common and catastrophic
especially in hospitalised and critically-ill patients and has now
been accepted as an important public health problem. However, the
literature on the influence of AKI on proceeding kidney function is
vague. In this study, we study the influence of AKI on long-term
kidney function amongst patients who were identified as having chronic
kidney disease.
