Jo Knight worked on this project with <a href="http://sunnybrook.ca/research/team/member.asp?t=12&m=371&page=172">Mario Masellis</a> from Sunnybrook Hospital
in Toronto
and in partnership with the pharmaceutical company TEVA. Results from
analysis of 692 participants of a drug trial showed that there was an
association between response to the drug and genetic variant an
individual would carry.
