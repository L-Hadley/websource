<p>
Meningitis is a major health problem across a wide swath of Africa, the so-called "Meningitis Belt".
Within this belt, intense localised outbreaks of meningitis can occur. The current vaccination 
strategy is reactive, treating areas when prevalence hits a threshold. We aim to produce a 
predictive model that could direct vaccination schemes to areas of high epidemic probability.
Our method uses dynamic regression models in space and time to produce predictions of the
meningitis rate.

There is also concern that climate change is causing the belt to spread, affecting new
populations across Africa.
