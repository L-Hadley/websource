<p>
Meningitis is a major health problem across a wide swath of Africa, the so-called "Meningitis Belt".
Within this belt, intense localised outbreaks of meningitis can occur. The current vaccination 
strategy is reactive, treating areas when prevalence hits a threshold. We aim to produce a 
predictive model that could direct vaccination schemes to areas of high epidemic probability.

<p>
There is also concern that climate change is causing the belt to spread, affecting new
populations across Africa.
