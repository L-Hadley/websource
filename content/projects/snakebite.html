<p>
Snakebite is one of the most important neglected tropical diseases in
the world largely affecting rural communities living in tropical and
subtropical countries. Sri Lanka has one of the highest incidence
rates for snakebite - according to hospital statistics about 37,000
patients are admitted to government hospitals due to snakebites
annually and hospital admissions are considerably varying among the
climatic zones of Sri Lanka.

<p>
This project involves modelling snakebite events based on
socio-demographic and geo-spatial predictors to develop a risk map.

CHICAS is collaborating with the Liverpool School of Tropical
Medicine, the <a href="http://www.imperial.ac.uk/grantham/">Grantham
Institute</a> at Imperial College, the University of Kelaniya and the
University of Tel Aviv in this project.
