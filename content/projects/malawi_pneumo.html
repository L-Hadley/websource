<p>
Streptococcus pneumoniae is a common coloniser of the human
nasopharynx, particularly in young children and in resource-poor
populations. In 2008 it was estimated to be responsible for over
500,000 deaths in children aged 1â€“59 months. Developing countries,
mostly in Africa and Asia, carry the highest burden pneumococcal
disease incidence in children.

In 2011 Malawi introduced 13-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine
(PCV13). The aim of the project is to analyse the variation in risk of
vaccine-type carriage with age, adjusted for child-specific baseline
characteristics, time since vaccination and calendar time of
measurement. Data used were collected through 4 cross-sectional
nasopharyngeal carriage surveys over a 16-month period in Blantyre,
Malawi, commencing June 2015.

This is a collaborative research project conducted with Todd Swarthout
from Malawi-Liverpool-Wellcome Trust and Neil French from from
Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine.
