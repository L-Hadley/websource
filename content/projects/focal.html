<p>
FOCAL-NTDs is an MRC funded project whose goal is to develop a
framework that enables vector-borne disease control efforts to be
targeted more effectively, with a specific focus on the neglected
tropical diseases (NTDs) schistosomiasis, human African
trypanosomiasis (also known as HAT or sleeping sickness), and
lymphatic filariasis (LF), plus malaria. This framework includes the
collection, visualisation and analysis of spatio-temporal disease risk
data at the relevant spatial scale to provide control programmes with
the information needed to implement targeted control strategies.
