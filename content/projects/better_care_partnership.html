  We are using qualitive and quantitative approaches to exploring the use of digital apps in care homes. For the qualitative work we undertook interviews and for the quantitative work we are using linked routinely collected data from care homes and hospitals. We are exploring health outcomes, resident trajectories and ease of use of digital technologies.
