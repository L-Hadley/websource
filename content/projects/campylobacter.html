<p>
Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of reported 
gastrointestinal illness in England and Wales.  While food-borne 
transmission is a major cause of these infections, a large proportion
of cases have no known origin.  The overall aims of this project are 
to identify the key reservoirs, environmental and social drivers of 
Campylobacter that affect human disease, analyse seasonal variations 
in pathogen load and their impacts on exposure and disease, understand
the relative roles of the transmission pathways and thus points of control,
and generate future projections of disease risk and its control.

To accomplish these goals, we are developing more sophisticated methodologies
for the integrated analysis of multiple datasets recorded at different spatio-temporal resolutions
