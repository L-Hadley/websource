<p>
Campylobacter is the most common bacterial cause of reported 
gastrointestinal illness in England and Wales.  While food-borne 
transmission is a major cause of these infections, a large proportion
of cases have no known origin. 
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://enigmaproject.org.uk/">ENIGMA Project</a>, a Liverpool-led consortium 
aims 
to identify the key reservoirs, environmental and social drivers of 
Campylobacter that affect human disease; analyse seasonal variations 
in pathogen load and their impacts on exposure and disease; understand
the relative roles of the transmission pathways and thus points of control;
and generate future projections of disease risk and its control.  
</p>
<p>
For its part in the project, Lancaster are developing more sophisticated methodologies
for the integrated analysis of multiple datasets recorded at different spatio-temporal resolutions.
