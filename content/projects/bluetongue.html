<p>
Bluetongue is a viral disease of sheep and cattle that has spread across Europe into the UK
in recent years. The virus is spread by biting midges across animal populations.
</p>
<p>
This project, funded by the BBSRC, will investigate several aspects of the disease, including:
<ul>
<li>Computer simulation modelling of viral spread</li>
<li>Midge capture, with species and DNA typing across farms</li>
<li>Spatial analysis and mapping of midge capture data</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
The project is being led by staff from the Liverpool Vet School, with Chicas
working on the spatial analysis part of the project.
