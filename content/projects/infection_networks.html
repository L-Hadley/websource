Influenza is an acute, contagious respiratory infection. Influenza
causes considerable mortality and morbidity each year and can be a
primary, underlying or contributing factor to cause of death. In
hospital, influenza poses a risk to both medical staff and patients;
it is one of the leading causes of respiratory infection and can be
fatal in the elderly. Vaccination remains the most effective method of
influenza prevention and control.
</p>
<p>
Medical communities and government commonly recommend seasonal
immunisation against influenza to reduce the occupational risk of
infection for HCWs and medical students. A suitable seasonal
vaccine is available and supplied to HCWs for free, and is highly
encouraged for anyone in the health care profession. Despite this only
54.8% all frontline HCWs choose to be immunised.

Social network analysis (SNA) has become an increasingly popular tool
in public health and epidemiological studies. Unlike some other
statistical approaches such as, Susceptible – Infected – Recovered
(SIR) models, SNA does not assume random mixing within a population,
rather that any population has a non-random structure and that this
influences interactions within it. Analysing network structures can be
highly informative, particularly when studying phenomena such as
transmission pathways for infectious diseases. SNA allows the
evaluation of an individual’s behaviour, taking into account the
influence of their spatial position within the social network.

It has been shown that individuals who are connected within a social
network may influence each other’s behaviour, even when not connected
directly. In the context of vaccination behaviour, Brunson (2013)
found that social networks play a role in parents’ vaccination
decision-making for their children. For the majority of parents
studied, the people included in their social networks were more
influential than other sources of information, such as the media; the
percentage of people recommending non-conformity held the highest
predictive power of parents’ vaccination decision. If an individual’s
vaccination decision is affected by their immediate social circle,
clusters of unvaccinated individuals can develop –and these clusters
may then facilitate outbreaks of infection. It may be the case that
there are similar influences at work when HCWs are making a decision
as to whether or not to get vaccinated against seasonal
influenza. However, despite increased interest in improving
vaccination uptake in this sub-population, vaccine uptake in HCWs has
not been studied from a social network perspective.  Research in the
field of communications analysis has shown that network analysis has
the potential to identify the structure of information diffusion
within a social network and identify influential
individuals. Therefore, in the case of HCWs seasonal influenza
vaccination it may be possible to identify (and target) highly
influential individuals within a network, in order to diffuse
vaccination practices and improve uptake rates. It is hoped that
improving vaccination uptake in HCWs will reduce their own
occupational risk; that of their colleagues’; and improve the safety
of their at risk patients.
