Jo Knight, Dr Mallar Chakravarty (Computational Neuroscientist, Brain
Imaging Centre, Douglas Institute) and graduate student Sejal Patel
have been examining the heritability of different structures in the
brain. The work has been published in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23654/abstract">Human Brain Mapping</a>
and <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29742386">Neuroimage</a>.
</p>
<p>
Jo has also worked with Mario
Masellis and Usman Saeed looking at specific genetic influences on brain
structure, published in
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29782824">Alzheimers and Dementia</a>.
</p>
<p>
Finally
she was involved in a study looking at the ability to classify
patients based on brain structure, published in
<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/?term=29274736">Schizophrenia Research</a>.
