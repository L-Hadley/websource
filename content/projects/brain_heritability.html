Jo Knight, Dr Mallar Chakravarty (Computational Neuroscientist, Brain
Imaging Centre, Douglas Institute) and graduate student Sejal Patel
have been examining the heritability of different structures in the
brain. The work has been published in <a href="http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/hbm.23654/abstract">Human Brain Mapping</a>. They are
now working to use this information in a machine learning framework
alongside for brain imaging phenotypes.
