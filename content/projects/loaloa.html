<p>
Our earlier work on Loa-loa modelling 
developed a model for the cumulative distribution function of
intensity of Loa Loa infection based on 
community-level
prevalence from rapid diagnostic tests. This allows us to estimate the proportion of the
community whose parasite counts exceed certain policy relevant
infection levels (for example 8,000 or 30,000 microfilariae/ml) which
correspond to high and very high risk of severe adverse events when
the individuals are treated with drugs used in the mass administration
programme to eliminate Lymphatic Filariasis.
</p>
<p>
In an extension of this project we will be updating our risk map 
by incorporating the latest data from both rapid diagnostic test
results and blood sample tests. The model also includes geographic
covariates that give a broad indication of habitat suitability for 
Loa-loa infection.
