<p>
Our earlier work on Loa-loa modelling developed a predictive map to
identify areas of high Loa loa prevalence by combining prevalence
survey data with satellite-derived environmental covariates in a
geostatistical model for the spatial variation in prevalence.  More
recently, we have been modelling the relationship between
community-level prevalence and the distribution of intensity of
Loa Loa infection amongst infected members of the community. This
allows us to estimate the proportion of the community whose parasite
counts exceed certain policy-relevant infection levels (for example
8,000 or 30,000 microfilariae/ml), using only prevalence data. The
importance of this is that highly infected individuals are at risk of
severe adverse events when treated with drugs used in mass
administration programmes to control Onchocerciasis and Lymphatic
Filariasis, but estimation of infection levels on a wide geographical
scale is much more expensive and time-consuming than estimating
prevalence.
