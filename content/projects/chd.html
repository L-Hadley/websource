<p>

Coronary heart disease (CHD) represents the biggest single cause of
death in the UK. CHD is currently the biggest contributor to
inequalities in premature deaths. These inequalities stem from
differences in CHD risk factors between socio-economic groups
(e.g. blood pressure, cholesterol). The differences in risk factors
are themselves the result of modifiable behaviours, primarily smoking
and nutrition.
</p>
<p>
The goals of the project are :
<ul>
  <li>Identify public health policies which could be used to improve CHD mortality and morbidity</li>
  <li>Assess the coverage of these policies across all socio-economic groups</li>
  <li>Determine the overall population-average effect and the gradient in the effect across socio-economic group</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Specifically, we have evaluations in various stages of development:
<ul>
  <li>Salt policies</li>
  <li>Trans fat policies</li>
  <li>Smoking policies</li>
</ul>
</p>
