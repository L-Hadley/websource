Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is an important public health issue. Its prevalence is around 5% in the
UK and it is frequently comorbid with other common diseases (e.g. hypertension, diabetes). For CKD
patients the risk of complications (e.g. vascular calcification) increases with decreasing kidney
function. Early intervention can reduce the number of patients progressing to dialysis/transplant and
reduce the risk of severe complications. Ongoing research seeks to identify secondary
care patients at greatest risk of losing kidney function.

Using clinical data we are studying the progression of CKD in a secondary care clinical setting using
the Chronic Renal Insufficiency Standards Implementation Study (CRISIS) data collected at Salford
Royal NHS Foundation Trust (UK). The CRISIS dataset is a prospectively collected observational study
of outcomes in non-dialysis CKD patients, with over 3500 adult patients at
Salford Royal NHS Foundation Trust since 2002, and followed up annually.

The primary aim of this research is to investigate the key factors that affect the hazard for the end-
points of interest: end-stage renal failure; acute cardiovascular event; death. Risk-factors under
consideration include laboratory-measured blood biomarkers and routinely available clinical and
socio-demographic variables. Progression towards end-stage renal failure is known to vary among
primary renal disease types. We therefore aim to identify the key factors that determine the rate of
loss of kidney function both between and within primary renal disease types.
