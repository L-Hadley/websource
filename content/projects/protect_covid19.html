The <a href="https://sites.manchester.ac.uk/covid19-national-project/">
PROTECT COVID-19 National Core Study</a> on transmission and
environment is a UK-wide research programme improving our
understanding of how SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is
transmitted from person to person, and how this varies in different
settings and environments. This improved understanding will enable
more effective measures to stop transmission, saving lives and getting
society back towards ‘normal’
</p>
<p>
Using data from the Office for National Statistics, Dr Edge and
PROTECT colleagues wish to answer new questions about the drivers of
these occupational differences by examining viral load and vaccination
status. In addition, we will explore in more depth how occupational
differences vary by ethnic group and region. We also want to look at
whether observed differences in COVID-19 positivity across occupations
translate to differences in the prevalence and severity of long-COVID.

      COVID-19 viral load vary by occupation?</p>

      and regional differences modify occupational risks of COVID-19 and
      Long-COVID?</p>

  <li><p>Does
      rate of COVID-19 vaccine uptake or previous COVID-19 infection by
      occupation act as a mediator for occupational differences in
      positivity rates?</p>

<h4>Main Findings/Outputs</h4>

  <dt>Vaccination uptake in different occupational groups</dt>
  <dd>
    Using nationwide population-level data, we calculated the
    proportion of people who had received two doses of a COVID-19
    vaccine (assessed on 31 August 2021) by detailed occupational
    categories in adults aged 40-64 and estimated adjusted odds ratios
    to examine whether these differences were driven by occupation or
    other factors, such as education. We also examined whether
    vaccination rates differed by ability to work from home. Our study
    population included 14,298,147 adults 40-64. Vaccination rates
    differed markedly by occupation, being higher in administrative
    and secretarial occupations (90.8%); professional occupations
    (90.7%); and managers, directors and senior officials (90.6%); and
    lowest (83.1%) in people working in elementary occupations. We
    found substantial differences in vaccination rates looking at
    finer occupational groups even after adjusting for confounding
    factors, such as education. Vaccination rates were higher in
    occupations which can be done from home and lower in those which
    cannot. Many occupations with low vaccination rates also involved
    contact with the public or with vulnerable people.
