<p>A number of CHICAS staff and students are working on data and models relating to the COVID-19
  pandemic.</p>

<p>Jon Read, Jessica Bridgen, Chris Jewell and colleagues from the Universities of Florida and Glasgow
  produced <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1.full.pdf">a paper</a> based on the early data from Wuhan. 
</p>

<p>Max Eyre has built <a href="https://maxeyre.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/">a web application</a> for plotting case counts and other time-series data from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins CSSE</a>.</p>
