<p>A number of CHICAS research staff and students are now devoting
much of their research efforts to COVID-19-related activity. Our
modelling activities are helping to advise and support pandemic
response and decision making in the UK and internationally. We
currently have representation on SPI-M (the modelling group advising
UK DHSC) and the WHO COVID-19 modelling group, as well as working with
regional NHS and public health groups.</p>

<h4>Early Outbreak Modelling</h4>
<p>Jon Read, Jessica Bridgen, Chris Jewell and colleagues from the Universities of Florida and Glasgow
  produced <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1.full.pdf">a paper</a> based on the early data from Wuhan. 
</p>


<h4>International Case/Death Dashboard</h4>
<p>Max Eyre has built <a href="https://maxeyre.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/">a web application</a> for plotting case counts and other time-series data from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins CSSE</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/guidance/coronavirus-covid-19-information-for-the-public">Public Health England</a>.</p>


<h4>UK/World Map Dashboard</h4>
<p>Simon Alderton has produced a <a href="http://www.geospatialmodelling.com/covid-19">web-based dashboard</a> for the analysis
of the latest UK (PHE) and international (JH) data collected
from the outbreak. Items include animated representations of
transmission at different spatial scales through time, and numbers of
  tests performed, and cases identified, in the UK.
  </p>

<h4>Real-time Epidemic Mapping</h4>
<p>
Peter Diggle and Claudio Fronterr√® have been working with colleagues
at Swansea University for the Welsh government to map the epidemic in
near-real time using data-feeds from the Covid Symptom Reporting App,
and with colleagues imperial College to conduct geospatial analyses of
the <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.11.30.20239806v1">REACT</a> series
of randomised Covid prevalence surveys.
</p>

<h4>Care Homes during COVID</h4>
<p>
The coronavirus pandemic hit care homes hard - leading to a doubling
of deaths among residents during the April 2020 peak of the pandemic.
Now a team of researchers led by Lancaster University, including data
scientists and clinicians, aim to gain a clearer picture of how
COVID-19 patients were managed in UK care homes as the pandemic
unfolded.  Their research will offer insights into how different homes
dealt with the crisis and provide valuable information to help guide
Government, care home managers and staff in future crises.
