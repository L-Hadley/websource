<p>A number of CHICAS research staff and students are now devoting
much of their research efforts to COVID-19-related activity. Our
modelling activities are helping to advise and support pandemic
response and decision making in the UK and internationally. We
currently have representation on SPI-M (the modelling group advising
UK DHSC) and the WHO COVID-19 modelling group, as well as working with
regional NHS and public health groups.</p>

<p>Jon Read, Jessica Bridgen, Chris Jewell and colleagues from the Universities of Florida and Glasgow
  produced <a href="https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.01.23.20018549v1.full.pdf">a paper</a> based on the early data from Wuhan. 
</p>

<p>An updated list of related preprints and publications will be kept in the links section of this web page.</p>

<p>Max Eyre has built <a href="https://maxeyre.shinyapps.io/shinyapp/">a web application</a> for plotting case counts and other time-series data from <a href="https://github.com/CSSEGISandData/COVID-19">Johns Hopkins CSSE</a>.</p>
