<p>
There is some research that suggests schizophrenia is an autoimmune
disorder like multiple sclerosis, Crohnâ€™s or rheumatoid arthritis
where the immune system misfires and attacks the body. Jo Knight has worked
with Dr Jennie Pouget from the University of Toronto to demonstrate
the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27242348">genetic architecture of the traits is quite different</a>.
They are currently
undertaking further work to establish if the risk loci for a variety
of autoimmune disorders overlap with those for schizophrenia.
