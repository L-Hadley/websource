<p>
CHICAS is working with colleagues in Malawi to develop a monitoring &
evaluation tool, which will be applied to assess the progressive
impact, over time and geographical space, of a five-year malaria control programme
covering the population living in the Majete Wildlife Reserve.
</p>

<p>
Researchers from Wageningen, Amsterdam, Malawi and Liverpool are
conducting the control programme, where interventions will consist
of early diagnosis and treatment, mass coverage of insecticide-treated
bed nets, house improvement and larval source management. Special
attention is being paid to community involvement, to ensure a lasting
and sustainable effect of the malaria control interventions through
the creation of malaria animators and community-based malaria action
teams.
</p>
 
 
<p>
The overall aim of the project is to achieve a reduction of 80% or more in malaria-associated
morbidity and  50% or more in malaria prevalence.
