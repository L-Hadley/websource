<p>
Spatially targeting malaria control interventions in areas of high
disease burden will become a more cost-effective and sustainable
approach for national programmes in the era of elimination. To achieve
this the geographical scale in which to implement control and identify
the most likely sources and routes of infection are
critical. Wind-assisted mosquito dispersal is an important, yet
currently undervalued, source of information to track the spread of
malaria and predict outbreaks.  We will develop and apply a model,
previously and successfully used to track the wind-borne spread of
Bluetongue virus by midges, to predict the spread of malaria in a
rural region of southern Malawi. The ‘spatial-temporal wind-outbreak
trajectory simulation’ (SWOTS) model developed by Luigi Sedda and
colleagues at Oxford, will use wind data, household infection status
and insect flight parameters to determine the most likely source and
route of infection during the rainy season. We will empirically
validate the output from SWOTS using a simple mark-recapture field
experiment to determine the influence of wind direction and speed on
vector movement.

This pilot project will determine the applicability of SWOTS as a risk assessment and disease
preparedness tool for malaria in rural Africa and lay the foundations to extend to other transmission
settings and vector-borne disease systems.
