<p>
The noisy knees project is about developing a device which uses
acoustic emission as noninvasive biomarker to detect and to
differentiate between different levels of severity of knee
osteoarthritis. This would allow easier, cheaper and more refined
diagnosis than currently used MRI scans. The idea is that if it can
pick up small changes in the knee joint, it can also be used in the
dynamic assessment during clinical trials and in stratified medicine.

The project involves Chicas staff working with colleagues from across
the faculty, as well as industrial partners involved in product
testing and development aiming to bring the technology to
market. The <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/shm/research/projects/noisy-knees/">Noisy
Knees Project Page</a> has more information.
