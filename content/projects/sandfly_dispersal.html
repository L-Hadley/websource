<p>
The dispersal of hematophagous arthropods is a key factor determining
the spread of the pathogens that they transmit. Traditional
capture-mark-recapture studies of dispersal require that the marking
technique has limited impact on the dispersal behaviour and survival
of the individual. Phlebotomine sandflies and Culicoides are therefore
challenging subjects, due to their small size, fragility and local
abundance.
</p>
<p>
An immunomarking technique was successfully used to quantify the dispersal of
Palaearctic Culicoides. By marking individuals with food-based proteins as they emerge or
move through the habitat prior to capture, the immunomarking technique can address
some of the limitations of capture-mark-recapture. The technique uses a sensitive ELISA
that requires non-specialist equipment.
</p>
<p>
We will validate an immunomarking technique developed for Culicoides to study
sand fly dispersal ecology. We will transfer the technique across vector groups
using colony-derived insects and field studies in Brazil targeting Lutzomyia vectors
of Leishmania.
</p>
<p>
We hypothesise that due to the similarities in the biology of Culicoides and sandflies, the
immunomarking technique can be adapted for use with the main South American
Lutzomyia vectors to quantify their dispersal behaviour. Standardisation of
immunomarking for sandflies will facilitate studies at different spatial scales and habitats to
examine flight behaviour, resting and breeding sites.
