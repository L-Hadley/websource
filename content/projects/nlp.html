Along with an intern from the University of Ottawa, Jo Knight has
worked on a project to use NLP to identify specified Gene Ontology
terms within publications. This allows researchers to develop new
hypothesis about genes to study. Jo received Wellcome Trust Seed
funding in August 2016 to expand this project and is working with computer
scientists to develop a method to incorporate NLP results with
association statistics to identify genetic risk variants.
