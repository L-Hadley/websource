Along with an intern from the University of Ottawa, Jo Knight has
worked on a project to use NLP to identify specified Gene Ontology
terms within publications. This allows researchers to develop new
hypotheses about genes to study. Jo received Wellcome Trust Seed
funding in August 2016 to expand this project and is working with Paul
Rayson, Mahmoud El-Haj and Scott Piao to investigate new ways of using
NLP and corpus linguistics in genetics. The work is being presented at
the International Genetic Epidemiology Society meeting in September
2017.
