Jo received Wellcome Trust Seed funding in August 2016 to investigate
the application of NLP and corpus linguistics tools and techniques on
scientific publications. The team includes Paul Rayson, Mahmoud El-Haj
and Scott Piao, Sheryl Prentice and Nathan Rutherford. Comparisons of
term frequency between psychiatric genetic and immune genetics
literature have revealed interesting patterns. The work was
presented at the International Genetic Epidemiology Society meeting in
September 2017 and the Language Resource Evaluation Conference in
Japan in December 2018. For more details see
