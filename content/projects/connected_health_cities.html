Jo Knight is the Academic Director at Lancaster for the Connected
Health Cities Project. The
North West Coast grouping is a collaboration between Lancaster
University, Liverpool University, AIMES grid services and the
Innovation agency. The aim is to use data to improve healthcare. At
Lancaster we have four PhD students working on different aspects of
this issue as well and MSc provision. We also have work force
development and business engagement projects. Nick King is the Project
Lead.
