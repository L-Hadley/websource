<p>
Cystic Fibrosis is one of the most common genetic diseases in white
populations. Survival has hugely improved over the last 50 years but
these advances are not shared equally across the population. Although
incidence is independent of socio-economic status, outcomes are much
worse in individuals from poorer backgrounds. We are using routinely
collected data to identify when, in the life course of individuals with
Cystic Fibrosis, inequalities arise and therefore what policies can be
developed to prevent these.

This project is led by David Taylor-Robinson at the University of
Liverpool and is part of the EpiNet Strategic Research Centre which is
a collaboration of clinicians and researchers from the Royal Brompton
Hospital, Imperial College London, London School of Hygiene and
Tropical Medicine, University of Liverpool, Lancaster University,
University of East Anglia and University of Nottingham. EpiNet is
funded by the Cystic Fibrosis
Trust.
