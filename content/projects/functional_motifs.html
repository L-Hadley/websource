<p>
Researchers have identified many DNA motifs that have genetic function
such as those that bind transcription factors. Jo Knight, Kartikay
Chadha (Jo's graduate student in Toronto)
and <a href="http://www.sickkids.ca/AboutSickKids/Directory/People/P/Andrew-Paterson.html">Professor
Andrew Paterson</a> are looking to see if they can identify motifs
associated with genetic risk variants. This would enable risk variants
to be more easily identified in future studies.
