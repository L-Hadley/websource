The Health e-Research Centre is a Manchester-led consortium whose
work is directed at improving public
health by innovative use of health-
service data. CHICAS works on the
development of statistical methods
for detecting unusual patterns in
space and/or time. A recent example
is the discovery of very large
geographical variations in the 
prescribing of methylphenidate for
the treatment of ADHD.
