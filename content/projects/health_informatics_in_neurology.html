<p>
Clinicians lack confidence in ‘high-level’ neurology service data,
particularly when these have been generated where there may be a lack
of adequate validation. There is a pressing need to improve both the
quality of data and the approach to its analysis.
</p>
<p>
There are number of
approaches that could be applied to improve the analysis undertaken
and some examples are given here:
<ol><li> Machine learning methods can be
used to improve sub type diagnosis by incorporating a range of data
    types ranging from clinical blood tests results to length of stay.</li>
  <li>
Novel spatiotemporal analysis techniques being developed in our
department can be used to integrate date types that are aggregated
across different but overlapping geographical areas.</li>
<li> New
visualisation techniques can be applied to clinical pathways to allow
  for effective communication between analysts and clinicians.
</li>
</ol>
