Together with colleagues
from <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/" title="Lancaster
Environment Centre">LEC</a>, we are working on a project to model risk
of flooding and drought on food production and distribution for cities in
the heart of the Amazon region.
</p>
<p>
A Â£300,000 <a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/">ESRC</a> fellowship awarded to 
<a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/about-us/people/luke-parry">Luke Parry</a> of
LEC is funding development of statistical models of possible food production and supply
problems along the Amazon river system. By combining geographical data on 
navigational routes and food distribution networks with real-time river flow and 
height data we aim to produce an early-warning system for urban vulnerability to
food insecurity.
