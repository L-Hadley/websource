<p>
Together with colleagues from the <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/" title="Lancaster
Environment Centre">Lancaster Environment Centre</a> (LEC), we are working on a project to model the impacts
of droughts and flooding on vulnerability to food insecurity for city-dwellers living in the heart of 
the Amazon region. We are investigating how food price variability interacts with poverty and 
livelihood strategies to determine food security, including perceptions of access and levels of 
consumption.

A Â£300,000 <a href="http://www.esrc.ac.uk/">ESRC</a> fellowship awarded to
<a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/about-us/people/luke-parry">Luke Parry</a> of the LEC is 
funding development of statistical models of food distribution (including journey time and costs) 
along the Amazon river system. By combining geographical data on food distribution networks 
with real-time hydrological data and proxies of adaptive capacity in cities we aim to produce an 
early-warning system for urban vulnerability to food insecurity.
