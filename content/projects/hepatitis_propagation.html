In collaboration with researchers from Los Alamos National Laboratory
in the USA, we are working on a project to characterize the
propagation patterns of Hepatitis C Virus in human livers. We are
developing spatio-temporal point process models accounting for rates
of hepatocyte infection, viral production, and immune responses that
will help to understand the mechanics of infection in the liver.
