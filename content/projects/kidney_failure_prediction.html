<p>
Renal disease can be asymptomatic for many years, but early detection
and treatment can slow the rate of progression towards renal
failure. Analysis of routinely collected biomarkers of kidney function
can assist early detection. Current UK guidelines use the estimated
glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) as an overall measure of kidney
function and recommend that a patient who is losing kidney function at
a relative rate of at least 5% per year, as measured by their eGFR,
should be referred to a specialist treatment centre. In this study, we
consider use of dynamic linear modelling to obtain the predictive
distribution of the underlying rate of change in kidney function. Our
overall aim is to incorporate model-based predictions into a real-time
surveillance system that can alert general practitioners to the
possible need for the referral of their patient to a specialist
treatment centre.
