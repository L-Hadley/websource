<p>
The Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine (LSTM) and Lancaster University (LU) have been
successful in their joint application for a Medical Research Council Translational and Quantitative 
Skills Doctoral Training Programme in Global Health.
</p>

<p>
The objectives of the programme are:

<ul>
  <li>to develop future leaders in <em>translational research</em> relevant to
    Global Health.</li>
  <li>to develop researchers with <em>quantitative and interdisciplinary skills</em>.</li>
  <li>to develop <em>bridge scientists</em> who can translate scientific
    innovation into beneficial impact on health for the World’s most
    vulnerable people and communities.
  </li>
</ul>
</p>

<p>
Recruited students will receive formal training in translational research, including projects with
external organisations and industry. They will undertake a 1 + 3 PhD programme, receiving formal 
training in translational research (options to include an MRes in Biomedical Sciences and 
Translational Medicine or MRes in Clinical Sciences) that will feature 3 x 12 week projects (one 
with an external organization e.g. AstraZeneca, Medecins Sans Frontieres, Medicines for Malaria 
Venture). The strategic partnership between  is designed to ensure the integration, development 
and delivery of quantitative skills training.
</p>
<p>
Up to seven fully funded (fees plus stipend PhD studentships) will be
available per intake year, with the first intake in October 2016.
Recruitment to the programme will be through LSTM, but both LSTM and
LU staff will be involved in the programme, often as co-supervisors,
and each student’s primary working base could be in either institution
depending on the scientific focus of their project. Interested
students from relevant backgrounds such as mathematics, statistics,
life sciences social sciences, clinical sciences or public health can
obtain more information about the scheme by visiting the 
<a href="http://www.lstmed.ac.uk/study/research-degrees/mrc-doctoral-training-partnership">MRC-DTP web site</a>.
</p>
<p>
Potential applicants whose interests lies in the development and
application of statistical and/or epidemiological methods to global
public health research are advised to contact <a href="/people/diggle.html">Prof Peter Diggle</a>
(<a href="mailto:p.diggle@lancaster.ac.uk">p.diggle@lancaster.ac.uk</a>)
for an informal discussion before applying.
