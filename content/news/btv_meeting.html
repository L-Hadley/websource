On the 22<sup>nd</sup> of August CHICAS will be holding a one-day
workshop entitled "Mitigating Ongoing Risk Of Bluetongue Epidemics
Through Efficient Control And Protection Zones Limits"
</p>
<p>
This will be an opportunity to review recent advances in bluetongue
epidemiology including dispersal processes and reservoir species roles
that impact the efficacy of control zone limits. We will ascertain
whether updates are required to current statutory control measures and
how we can support these changes.
