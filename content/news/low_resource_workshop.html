<p>
The International Workshop on Disease Mapping in Low-Resource
Settings, held at Lancaster University on 14-15 September 2017, has
brought together world-leading experts in epidemiology and statistics
to discuss public health challenges in developing countries. The event
was organized by Emanuele Giorgi, a CHICAS member, and funded by his
MRC Fellowship in Biostatistics.
</p><p>
The workshop saw researchers from 28 international research institutes
- also featuring the World Health Organization - based in 10 different
countries, including Ethiopia, Indonesia and South Africa. Eleven
invited talks, a networking session, twenty rapid-fire talks and a
poster session took place over the two days. The themes covered during
the event were: effectively conveying uncertainty to policy makers;
how to make maps of disease risk useful for decision making;
cutting-edge methods for downscaling of prevalence; ecological
mapping; spatio-temporal modelling of disease risk using data from
surveillance systems.
</p><p>
The participants have shown enthusiasm and provided strong positive
feedback for this event. This was especially thanks to the well chosen
speakers and to the fact that, being on a small scale, it also allowed
all participants to better know each other in a more informal context
than most conferences.
</p><p>
Emanuele has now plans to run a second edition of the workshop which
he hopes will become an annual regular event under the CHICAS brand.
</p><p>
Emanuele also acknowledges support from the Lancaster Medical School
which significantly contributed to make this event a remarkable
success.
