<p>
The prediction modelling for the Alder Hey hospital admissions project went live yesterday.
This will provide the hospital with predictions for medical and surgical admissions for
a two week forecast. A web site will show graphs and tables for easy interpretation of
results from a complex statistical prediction model. See the project link for more details.
