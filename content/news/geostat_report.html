This week saw the running of the tenth Geostat Summer School. This
event, which has also run around the globe in places such as Bergen,
Split, Canberra, and Quebec, brought researchers and lecturers in
open-source spatial statistics and geographic data to Lancaster for an
intensive week of lectures and workshops.
</p>
<p>
A total of 55 students attended, with every continent represented
apart from Antarctica. They came from a wide range of disciplines in
the physical, environmental, and social sciences. The course modules,
taught by world experts in the field, were all well attended and the
students were often found wanting to attend both parallel sessions.
</p>
<p>
The two prize winners were Jean Gaudart for his accurate rainfall prediction
for the spatial prediction contest, and Robin Lovelace for his interactive
data explorer in the mapping and visualisation contest. They will both have
book vouchers to spend.
</p>
<p>
Outside of the academic activities, the group enjoyed a midweek break with a 
party at The Gregson Institute, where some took the challenge of the open
mic and musical instruments to entertain their peers. At the end of the week,
the Lake District was the venue for our semi-relaxing excursion, as some
strolled round Derwentwater and others hauled themselves up Catbells Fell 
to enjoy the view from above.
</p>
<p>
The students were left with lots to think about and incorporate into their
research in the coming months, and many interesting new collaborations
may well have been started at this summer school.
</p>
<p>
The event was organised by Barry Rowlingson locally, and the academic
programme and global Geostat administration was by Tomislav Hengl of
Wageningen University. The venue for next year is yet to be decided,
but the course should be just as popular.
