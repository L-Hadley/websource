<p>
Every year Google run their "Google Summer of Code" (GSoC) scheme, funding students
to develop open source software. This year a 
<a href="https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5197021490184192">
project proposed by Barry
Rowlingson
</a> has been accepted and the student, Kevin Stadler, will
start working on it shortly. Kevin is a PhD student at the University of 
Edinburgh and is currently a contributor to open-source projects. The 
project is co-mentored by <a href="http://blogs.egu.eu/divisions/essi/author/wagemann/">Julia Wagemann</a>.
</p>
<p>
The aim of the project is to enable applications that might not have
powerful geographic mapping functions to control QGIS, the leading
open-source geographic information system. In this way, statistical
packages such as R, and programming languages such as Python
can leverage QGIS to produce high-quality cartography or use 
its interactive digitising and editing functions.
</p>
<p>
The project lasts for four months and pays the student a stipend to
work on the project. All work is done remotely, and supervision is by
regular teleconferences and online discussions.
</p>
<p>
Barry has mentored two other GSoC projects in the past, and has
literally "got the T-shirt", which is one of the benefits for GSoC mentors.
