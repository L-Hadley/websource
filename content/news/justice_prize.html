<p>
The work of Chicas PhD student Justice Aheto has been identified for
its potential impact in the study of child malnutrition in Ghana, his
home country. The work aims to identify factors that increase the risk
of malnutrition and combines several statistical techniques with a
number of different datasets.
</p>

<p>
The contest challenges researchers in mathematical sciences to
describe their research in 250 words for a general audience, and is
open to students from all European universities.
</p>

<p>
Justice will be collecting his prize at an awards function
in Oxford on the 23rd of November.
