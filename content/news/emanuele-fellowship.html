Emanuele Giorgi, a current PhD student in CHICAS, has been awarded an
MRC Fellowship which will see him travelling between Lancaster and Malawi
to investigate patterns of disease in Africa. He said:

<p class="quote">
This is an important achievement that will help to advance my career
and give me the opportunity to form key collaborations with experts in
spatial epidemiology. I am extremely delighted that I will continue my
research based in Lancaster, a city and a research environment that
have been giving me the serenity and the enthusiasm that were needed
to win the award.

After graduating in his native Italy, Emanuele moved to Lancaster
to start his PhD in CHICAS, winning the International Biometric
Society's <a href="emanuele-prize.html">Student Showcase Research Prize</a> in his second year. He hopes one day to combine his geostatistical 
skills with another of his interests - dinosaurs!
