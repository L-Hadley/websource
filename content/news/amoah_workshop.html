PhD candidate student Benjamin Amoah has been visiting the Kenya Medical 
Research Institute in Nairobi for the delivery of a four-day workshop from the 25th to the 28th of June. He was 
teaching staff from the health ministries of six African countries (Kenya,
D.R. Congo, Uganda, Sudan, Somalia, Mozambique) the fundamentals of
disease mapping.

Benjamin says "The participants were excited to learn and to
appreciate the statistics and mathematics that go into malaria
mapping. Being equipped with the knowledge of how they themselves can
map malaria in their respective countries using the R 'Shiny' web app
and how to interpret their results is something each participant was
happy about. They are looking forward to training their other
colleagues in their respective National Malaria Control Programs when
they get back to their countries."
