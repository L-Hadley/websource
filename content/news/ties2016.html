<p>
This is one of the few occasions where new methods for vector-borne
disease mapping and control will be discussed in an International
Conference.  It also comes timely with the increase scientific and
public interests for the emergence of human and animal vector-borne
diseases in new geographic areas (as Zika for example).
</p>
<p>
The invited speakers for this session are: Dr Chris Jewell (CHICAS)
with a talk on “Outbreak response forecasting for vector borne
diseases”; Dr Victor Alegana (University of Southampton) with a talk
on “Effect of environmental and ecological factors on malaria vector
density in Tororo district in Uganda”; and Dr Michelle Stanton (Liverpool School
of Tropical Medicine) with a
talk on “The role of statistical models in tsetse control: theory vs
practice.”.
