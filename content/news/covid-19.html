A number of CHICAS research staff and students are now devoting
much of their research efforts to COVID-19-related activity. Our
modelling activities are helping to advise and support pandemic
response and decision making in the UK and internationally. We
currently have representation on SPI-M (the modelling group advising
UK DHSC) and the WHO COVID-19 modelling group, as well as working with
regional NHS and public health groups. You can read more about our work on the <a href="/projects/covid_19.html">COVID-19</a> project page.
