Chicas researcher Theresa Smith recently returned from a week-long workshop
funded by the British Council Researcher Links programme. She said:
</p>
<p class="quote">The workshop re-emphasized for me that by
collaborating with scientists, medics, vets, community leaders and
other experts, statisticians and epidemiologists (like those in
Chicas) can help create a lot of good in the world.
</p>

<p>The goal of the
workshop was to bring early career researchers together to learn
about and discuss One Health research.  Broadly speaking, One Health
research is about considering the greater context of
human-animal-environmental interfaces when investigating a particular
disease.  The workshop focused on zoonoses - diseases that can pass
from animals to humans - as well as diseases that pass from wildlife
to domestic animals.  Throughout the workshop, the meaning of One
Health itself was debated along with the challenges and benefits of
doing multi disciplinary research.</p>

<p >The location
provided endless examples of health issues arising from close contact
between humans, domestic animals, wildlife, and the environment. 
There are several zoonoses - including rabies, Rift Valley Fever,
anthrax, and bovine TB - that can have a direct impact on human health
in the communities surrounding the Kruger National Park.  These
infections occasionally pass directly from wildlife to humans but are
often transmitted through dogs and livestock. 
</p>
<p >Other infections
transmitted from wildlife to livestock have serious economic effects
on the surrounding communities.  Cattle herders from the area cannot
sell their animals or meat internationally or even to other parts of
South Africa because the wild African buffalo found in the park and
surrounding reserves can pass foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) to the
cattle.

<p >Along with some
traditional game drives into the Kruger, we visited the town of
Hluvukani where state-employed vets conduct weekly inspections of
cattle herds for FMD.  We also visited a veterinary
clinic run by the University of Pretoria,  which conducts
surveillance projects for rabies and FMD, and a human clinic from
which University of Pretoria researchers are running a surveillance
program for zoonotic infections.</p>
