<h3>Joining CHICAS in Autumn 2015</h3>
<p>
I am a Lecturer in Spatial Epidemiology. I spent most of my research in developing and implementing 
geostatistical spatio-temporal models for veterinary, zoonotic and human diseases (e.g. 
trypanosomiasis, Dengue, malaria, Schmallenberg, Bluetongue), biological systems and earth 
science.  My main interests are in the inclusion of biological process (e.g. population dynamics) in 
geographic statistical frameworks; and in the development of new protocols for risk assessment of 
vector-borne diseases within one-health risk governance.

When my children are asleep and means and variances leave my attention, I enjoy reading 
and writing poems (mostly in Italian).
