<p>
I am a Lecturer in Spatial Epidemiology. I work on the integration of
biological and statistical models in geostatistical and ecological
frameworks to produce risk maps of infectious diseases, species
distribution and species dispersion.  My main interest is in animal
and human vector-borne diseases. I made important contributions on the
dispersion of animal midge-borne diseases through wind and on the
identification of vector foci (reservoir/sources) for integrated
vector control.

Main research areas of interest:
<ul>
<li>Vector borne disease mapping;</li>
<li>Cross-correlation analysis at fixed points in space;</li>
<li>Wind-vector-borne diseases modelling;</li>
<li>Cell-automata epidemiology; </li>
<li>Population-based ecological models;</li>
<li>Species distribution modelling;</li>
<li>Risk mapping and risk assessment standardization for public health and veterinary risk management; </li>
<li>One-health frameworks;</li>
<li>Bayesian-geostatistical discriminant analysis;</li>
<li>Poverty mapping.</li>
</ul>
