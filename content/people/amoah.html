I am PhD student in Spatial Epidemiology at the Centre for Health
Informatics Computation and Statistics (CHICAS, Lancaster
University). My work, supervised by Prof. Peter John Diggle, focuses
on developing and applying statistical methods relevant to the
geospatial analysis of large-scale and community-based studies aimed
at improving our understanding of social and climatic factors
affecting spatial and temporal variation in health outcomes. I
currently work on malaria, undernutrition and Loa loa mapping in
Africa.

I hold a BSc degree in Mathematics from Kwame Nkrumah University of
Science and Technology, an MSc degree in Mathematical Sciences from
the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS) and an MPhil in
Mathematics from Cape Coast University, all in Ghana.
