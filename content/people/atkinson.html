<p>
My research can be characterized as "spatial data science" and it arises out of the application
of quantitative methods to geographical data. Specifically, it involves the application of space-time
statistics and geostatistics, machine learning and spatially explicit numerical modeling, to Earth
observation (EO) and other environmental and social data, to answer a wide range of science and
social science questions. My research is, thus, highly inter-disciplinary and spans a wide
range of statistical and numerical techniques and a wide range of science and social science
domains.

I have a major interest in the spatial epidemiology of vector-borne disease transmission
systems, such as malaria and Trypanosomiasis, based on:

<ul>
<li>Spatial and spatio-temporal regression models to predict risk (e.g., incidence, prevalence) in
space-time so that interventions can be targeted.</li>
<li>Agent-based models of the transmission dynamics such as to connect management changes in
the landscape with disease and poverty outcomes.</li>
</ul>

I am keen to supervise exceptional PhD students with a strong
mathematical, statistical or computer science background, who have an
interest in these research topics. If you are interested in applying
for a PhD in any of these topics please contact me at
