<p>
Jo Knight arrived at Lancaster Medical School in January 2016 and
became a Professor in 2018. She is the Research Director for the
Medical School and the theme lead for the  <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/dsi/">Data Science Institute</a>. Her
main expertise lies within statistical genetics - analysing genetic
data to identify variants that increase risk of complex traits.
</p>
<p>
Jo
publishes both applied and methodological work in journals including
Nature and Nature Genetics. The diseases that she has most experience
in include psychiatric, autoimmune traits and cardio-vascular
disease. Data integration has been the focus of her recent
methodological work including approaches to incorporate data from
genome wide association studies with additional functional information
about the genome or individual genes. More recently Jo has research
under the broad title of using NHS held data to improve health
records. In this area she works with a multidisciplinary group of 4
students from across 3 faculties and supervises a PhD student and an
MD student in her own department. She has a good track record of
funding both in her previous position in Canada (2012-1015) and since
arriving at Lancaster in 2016 including a Wellcome Trust grant as
PI.
</p>
<p>
Jo is involved in a number of collaborations, for example she
helped control data access to the Schizophrenia dataset collated by
the <a href="https://www.med.unc.edu/pgc">Psychiatric Genomic Consortium</a> from 2014 to 2018. She worked at
the University of Toronto from 2012-2015 and previous to that she
worked at Kings College London after getting her PhD at Queen Mary
University London.
