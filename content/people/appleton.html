<p>
I am a PhD student in Statistics and Epidemiology in the CHICAS
Research Group within Lancaster Medical School, where my supervisors
are Chris Jewell and Barry Rowlingson.
</p>
<p>
The main aim of my research is to recognise spatial patterns in
recorded illnesses of small animals from veterinary data, which will
aid in trying to predict any outbreaks in future.
</p>
<p>
Previously, I studied at Liverpool John Moores University and
University of Manchester obtaining BSc (Hons) Mathematics and MSc Data
Science, respectively.
