I am a second-year PhD student in the Statistics and Epidemiology
program at CHICAS, working under Peter Diggle, Jon Read, and Nick
Feasey (LSTM). My PhD is being funded by the <a href="http://idmod.org/">Institute for Disease
Modeling</a> in Seattle, USA, with travel funding from the <a href="gatesfoundation.org">Bill and
Melinda Gates Foundation</a>.

My thesis is on methods to investigate risk factors and transmission
patterns of typhoid fever in Blantyre, Malawi. My work uses both
statistical and dynamic modeling approaches to address this
topic. Spatial data and genetic sequences have been collected for this
project, allowing for a unique approach to understanding typhoid
epidemiology. I plan to apply the results from these analyses to
inform environmental sampling and control strategies for the disease.

I currently have a Master of Science in Population and Public Health
from the University of British Columbia, along with a Bachelor of
Science (Honours) in Biology from Queen’s University. I received
funding from the Canadian Institutes of Health Research for my
master’s thesis, which focused on the development of contact networks
in the hospital setting, and modeling the transmission of respiratory
pathogens between healthcare workers. Before my current appointment, I
was an environmental health scientist at the BC Centre for Disease
Control in Vancouver, Canada.
