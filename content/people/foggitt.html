<p>
I am a PhD student in the CHICAS Research Group (Lancaster Medical
School), supervised by Dr. Luigi Sedda, Dr. Manoj Roy and Professor
Roger Pickup. My PhD research will focus on how to transform water,
sanitation and hygiene infrastructure and practices within informal
urban communities in Accra, Ghana, leading to sustainable and
measurable improvements in health outcomes.

Previously, I studied MSc Water, Sanitation and Health Engineering and
BA (Hons) International Development and International Relations at the
University of Leeds, with a period studying at the University of
Ghana.
