<p>
I am a PhD student at CHICAS Research Group of the Lancaster Medical
School and supervised by Prof. Peter Diggle and Dr. Emanuele Giorgi. I
formerly obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics and Master’s
degree in Mathematical Sciences from Federal University of Technology
Akure, Nigeria and African Institute for Mathematical Sciences,
Tanzania respectively.
</p><p>
For my undergraduate final year project, I worked on the development
of randomized response models for surveys on sexually transmitted
infections and the objective was to provide a statistical tool aimed
at reducing non-response bias.
</p><p>
My master’s degree at AIMS exposed me to a broad variety of
cutting-edge mathematical and statistical application to Science. My
MSc project focused on development of geostatistical models in order
to identify communities that need urgent treatment for river blindness
in Cameroon.
</p><p>
For my PhD, I will however be developing methods of visualizing and
real-time mapping of spatio-temporally referenced admissions data. The
methods shall be applied to COPD emergency admissions data in the UK.
