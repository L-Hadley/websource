<p>
I am a PhD student at CHICAS Research Group of the Lancaster Medical
School and supervised by Prof. Peter Diggle, Dr Emanuele Giorgi and
Prof. Jo Knight. I formerly obtained a Bachelor’s degree in Statistics
and Master’s degree in Mathematical Sciences from the Federal
University of Technology Akure, Nigeria and African Institute for
Mathematical Sciences, Tanzania respectively. I am the author of
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/SDALGCP/index.html">SDALGCP</a>,
an R package for analyzing spatially aggregated disease data.
</p>
<p>
My research focuses on the development of the statistical methodology
for disease risk mapping. Specifically, the development of novel
geostatistical methods for spatially aggregated data. I have developed
a geostatistical method to analyse river blindness data in Cameroon
and we are able to identify communities that need urgent
treatment. Also, I have developed a geostatistical framework for
analysing spatially aggregated health outcomes when one hypothesize
that the process that generates the data is spatially continuous. One
of the projects that I am currently working on is on the
spatio-temporal prediction of COPD emergency hospitalisation across
North West England.
