I am currently working with Professor Jo Knight, investigating the how
Coronavirus pandemic impacted care home care for residents in the
North East of England as part of the UKRI/NIHR rapid response call. We
are utilising linked data from care homes, emergency departments and
hospitals to build a complete description of pathways of care for
residents in the area.

I graduated from Lancaster University's MSc Data Science course in
2020. My dissertation project was based at University Hospitals of
Morecambe Bay NHS Foundation Trust, where I produced a forecasting
model to predict hourly admissions in each of the trust's major
emergency departments.

<p>
My research interests include statistical methods for routinely
collected healthcare data.
