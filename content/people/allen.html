<h3>Left CHICAS in June 2015</h3>
<p>
I am a Senior Research Associate in the CHICAS group. My project
is the evaluation of public health policies aimed at improving
heart disease rates across all socio-economic groups in the UK. I
collaborate closely with the Department of Public Health & Policy
at the University of Liverpool, as part of the <a href="http://www.lilac-healthequity.org.uk/">LiLaC</a>
collaboration.
