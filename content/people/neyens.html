<p>
 Thomas is a visiting FWO Research Fellow from Belgium. He obtained
 his MSc in Biology at the University of Antwerp (Belgium) and his MSc
 and PhD in Statistics at the University of Hasselt (Belgium). He
 currently works at the University of Hasselt and his research
 interests lie within the field of spatial statistics in ecology and
 conservation biology. He focuses on the use of citizen science in
 ecological research and attempts to build a general statistical
 framework to correctly analyze crowd-sourced data that are typically
 hampered by problems, such as the occurrence of preferential
 sampling. Within CHICAS, he mainly works together with Peter Diggle
 and Emanuele Giorgi.
