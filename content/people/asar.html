<p>
I am a second year PhD student in CHICAS, Lancaster Medical School. 
I am studying on a dual PhD, namely Statistics and Epidemiology, with Prof. Peter Diggle. 
I have mainly concentrated on longitudinal, time series and survival statistical methods,
with applications in the biomedical and health sciences. My studies are financially supported by a
full time research studentship at the overseas level, based on the Health e-Research Centre (HeRC)
funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), UK.

<p>
The projects within the scope of my PhD are:
<ul>
<li>Real-time monitoring of progression towards renal failure in primary care patients</li>
<li>Novel statistical methods for joint analysis of longitudinal and survival data</li>
<li>Investigation of the influences of acute kidney injury on long-term kidney function</li>
<li>Spectral analysis methods for high frequency time series data, with applications in knee joint repair</li>
</ul>
