<p>
Frank is a lecturer in Biostatistics. His research interests include
statistical genomics, hierarchical Bayesian models for drug and
treatment response, information sharing, transfer learning and group
mapping for transferring knowledge from in vitro to in vivo datasets,
network reconstruction from time-series and interventional data,
efficient inference in complex high-dimensional Bayesian models, and
parameter inference in models of biological systems.
</p>
<p>
He studied at the School of Informatics of the University of Edinburgh,
before doing a joint PhD at Biomathematics and Statistics Scotland
(BioSS). Frank has previously worked as a postdoctoral researcher at the
Netherlands Cancer Institute (NKI-AvL) and at the MRC Biostatistics Unit
in Cambridge. His work includes collaborations on cancer proteomics with
the Mills Lab at the MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston, Texas, and on
Type II Diabetes epidemiology with the MRC Epidemiology Unit.

Please contact me if you are interested in pursuing a PhD in machine
learning or statistical modelling for molecular biomedicine. I am
currently taking applications for a funded 3-year PhD project
(co-supervised with Professor Peter Diggle and Dr James Hensman)
entitled: <em>"Design and analysis for longitudinal animal studies with
high-dimensional outcomes."</em> See also <a href="nc3rs_hdla_advert.pdf">the formal advertisement</a>.
</p>
<p>
Two other potential PhD topics without attached funding that I am
currently offering are: 1) <em>"Data-driven cancer subtype discovery using
high-dimensional integrative clustering"</em> and 2) <em>"Machine Learning for
Drug Selection in Personalized Cancer Medicine"</em>.
