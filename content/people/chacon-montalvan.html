<p>
I am a PhD student in Statistics and Epidemiology in the Faculty of
Health and Medicine at Lancaster
University supervised by <a href="/people/taylor.html">Dr. Benjamin
Taylor</a> and <a href="http://www.lancaster.ac.uk/lec/about-us/people/luke-parry">Dr. Luke
Parry</a>.
Previously, I obtained my Master of Science degree in Statistics at
Lancaster University and my Bachelor and Engineering degree at
<a href="http://www.uni.edu.pe/">Universidad Nacional de Ingeniería</a>.
</p>
<p>
My current research involves developing spatio-temporal methods to
understand and predict the impact of extreme hydro-climatic events on
the public health of remote cities in the Brazilian Amazon
rainforest. With use of our models, we intend to develop an early
warning system to help the government take more informative decisions.
