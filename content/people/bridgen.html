<p>
I am a Statistics and Epidemiology PhD student in the CHICAS research
group of Lancaster Medical School supervised by Dr Jon Read and Dr
Chris Jewell. The aim of my research is to better understand the role
of social interactions in disease transmission. My PhD will primarily
use data collected by the Fluscape study in Guangzhou, China.

I hold a MSc in Epidemiology from the London School of Hygiene &
Tropical Medicine (LSHTM) and a BSc in Mathematics from the University
of East Anglia (UEA).
