I am a first year Statistics and Epidemiology PhD student in the
CHICAS research group at Lancaster University Medical School, and my
area of research is in using health informatics to improve
neurological care. My supervisors are Professor Jo Knight, Chair in
Applied Data Science, and Professor Hedley Emsley, Professor of
Clinical Neuroscience. Funded by an EPSRC Doctoral Training
Partnership through Lancaster University Data Science Institute I will
be using statistical and machine learning techniques to understand
patient data from neurology outpatient clinics.

My background is in medical planning in the British Army, where I also
completed a PGCert in Public Health. On leaving the Army I decided to
pursue a more analytical route and enrolled on a GradCert in
Statistics with Sheffield University. I then completed an MSc in Data
Science at Lancaster University, following a health pathway throughout
the course. My final research project for the MSc used local hospital
data to examine differences in stroke risk and survival between rural
and urban populations.

My interests lie in using patient data to improve health
outcomes. Much data is recorded by medical staff which is used for
diagnosis and treatment, however this data can also be used to
understand issues such as care pathways, patterns of diagnosis and
attendance.  Understanding these issues can help inform potential
changes in services which, in turn, enable better patient care.
