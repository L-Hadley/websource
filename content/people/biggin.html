I am a third year Statistics and Epidemiology PhD student in the CHICAS research group in the
Lancaster Medical School. My research focuses on how to use routinely collected health data to
help improve neurology outpatient services. My supervisors are Professor Jo Knight and
Professor Hedley Emsley, and Iâ€™m funded by an EPSRC Doctoral Training Partnership through
Lancaster University Data Science Institute.

I came from a background in medical planning in the British Army, where I also completed a
PGCert in Public Health. On leaving the Army I decided to pursue a more analytical route and
completed an MSc in Data Science at Lancaster University, following a health pathway
throughout the course.

My interests lie in using patient data to improve health outcomes. A large amount of medical and
administrative data is recorded as a patient moves though the medical system, and alongside
diagnosis and treatment, this data can also be used in research. Understanding issues such as
care pathways, patterns of diagnosis and referral can inform potential changes in services which,
in turn, can enable better patient care.
