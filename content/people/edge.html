I am currently working on a longitudinal study of Motor Neuron Disease as part of the
Trajectories of Outcome in Neurological Conditions (TONiC) Project. TONiC is a national
study examining the factors that influence quality of life in patients with neurological
conditions. It is one of the largest studies on quality of life in neurological conditions
ever performed in the UK.

My PhD was a mixed method study into the factors affecting seasonal influenza
vaccination uptake by healthcare workers in the UK. As part of this work, I used social
network analysis, spatial modelling, and qualitative research to investigate the
behavioural and social aspects of the influenza vaccination decision amongst a group of
medical students and foundation doctors. My PhD was funded by a studentship awarded
by The Colt Foundation - I am hoping to submit my PhD Thesis in early spring 2017.
