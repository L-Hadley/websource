I started my PhD in Statistics and Epidemiology in January 2014, under
the supervision of Dr Thomas Keegan and Dr Rachel Isba. Prior to this
I completed a degree in Mathematics with Biology at Newcastle
University in 2013. My interests lie in the effects and influences of
social network structure on disease epidemiology. As a part of my
research I am looking into reasons why seasonal influenza vaccine
uptake in health care workers remains low, from a network
perspective. I think this is particularly interesting as trends in
vaccination within a social group could have implications for
infection spread. In an attempt to add to the growing interest in this
area we plan to develop an influenza simulation model to use with the
collected network data.
