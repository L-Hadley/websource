<p>
Heidi E. Brown, PhD, MPH, has a research focus on understanding
vector-borne and zoonotic disease transmission dynamics as a means of
improving disease control.
</p>
<p>
She works to identify human disease risk through modeling vector, host
and pathogen distributions.  Current research areas include
vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, spatial epidemiology, and climate
change.
</p>
<p>
Dr Brown is collaborating with Dr Luigi Sedda on research related to
how environmental conditions can facilitate the spread and
establishment of vector-borne diseases.  In particular, on the
analysis of a challenging dataset concerning shifting trends in
Eastern Equine Encephalitis in the US.
