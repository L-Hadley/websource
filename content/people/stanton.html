<p>
Michelle is an MRC research fellow in CHICAS whose interests
predominantly lie in developing and applying statistical methods and
digital health tools to public health problems affecting low and
middle income countries (LMICs). Michelle undertook her PhD in spatial
epidemiology at CHICAS, following which she worked as a postdoctoral
researcher at the Liverpool School of Tropical Medicine. It was during
this time that she became interested in geospatial technology and
digital health and their potential public health applications in
LMICs. In particular, Michelle's work focuses on how spatio-temporally
referenced data from the field can be used to guide vector-borne
disease control activities. Michelle's MRC fellowship examines the
spatio-temporal variability in three neglected tropical diseases
(human African trypanosomiasis, schistosomiasis, lymphatic filariasis)
and malaria over small geographical areas.
