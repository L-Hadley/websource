<p>
I am a first year Statistics and Epidemiology PhD student in CHICAS
(Lancaster Medical School) supervised by Dr Frank Dondelinger, Dr Neil
Dawson and Prof. Peter Diggle.
</p>
<p>
As an undergraduate, I studied BSc Mathematics at the University of
Birmingham. In my third year I focused on Applied Mathematics,
including Medical Statistics, Fluid Mechanics and some Financial
Mathematics. I then studied MSc Statistics at the University of
Lancaster. My MSc dissertation was supervised by Prof. Peter Diggle,
looking at novel ways of using covariate and proxy data to map the
risk of locations in Western and Central Africa having a high
prevalence of the disease Loa Loa.
</p>
<p>
My PhD project will focus on developing methods for the design and
analysis for longitudinal studies with high-dimensional outcomes,
based on generalized linear mixed models and Gaussian processes. The
aim is to gain new scientific insights into developmental changes in
mouse brain function, and to demonstrate the effectiveness of the
high-dimensional longitudinal method for increasing the statistical
power and reducing the number of mice needed.
</p>
<p>
My studies are financially supported by a full time studentship,
awarded by the <a href="https://www.nc3rs.org.uk">NC3Rs</a>.
