<p>
I am interested in statistical methods for longitudal and spatial data analysis
and particularly their application to biomedical and health-related problems.
Currently I am involved in intensity modelling of the Loa Loa parasite in western and central Africa and I am
part of the project team for developing a new medical device to detect knee osteoarthritis.
