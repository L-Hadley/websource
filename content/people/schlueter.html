<p>
I am a postdoctoral research associate and my main interest is to aid
medical and public health research and to ultimately help improve
people's lives. In order to do so, my focus has changed from
biomathematics to statistics. I have developed a particular interest
in longitudinal data analysis, survival analysis and joint modelling
but I am generally excited about learning and developing different
statistical methods in order to be able to address various questions
of clinical importance or of interest to public health.
