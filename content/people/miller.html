Poppy has now completed her PhD with CHICAS!

<hr/>

<p>
I am a Statistics and Epidemiology PhD student in CHICAS (Lancaster
Medical School) supervised by Dr Chris Jewell and Prof. Peter
Diggle. My studies are financially supported by a full time research
studentship at the overseas level, based on the Health e-Research
Centre (HeRC) funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), UK.
</p><p>
I'm primarily interested in applied modelling of point patterns in
space and space-time. My research goals are to improve knowledge and
develop tools which aid medical and public health research to help
improve peoples lives. I am particularly drawn to zoonotic diseases
applications as these unite my interests in infectious diseases with
the goal of improved animal and human welfare.
</p><p>
My past projects (Honours project and summer research projects)
include developing a novel class of source attribution model for human
campylobacteriosis cases, developing deterministic SIR-SI models for
leptospirosis in sheep and abattoir workers, and investigating novel
methods for assessing the goodness of fit of stochastic SIR epidemic
models.
</p><p>
I am currently using spatio-temporal statistical models to quantify
rat prevalence in an urban slum in Brazil and quantify the effect of
rat density (and other covariates) on human leptospirosis risk.
