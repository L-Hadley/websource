<p>
I am a first year Statistics and Epidemiology PhD student in CHICAS
(Lancaster Medical School) supervised by Dr Chris Jewell and
Prof. Peter Diggle.
</p><p>
I did my undergraduate degree in statistics at Massey University in
New Zealand. For my honours project, I worked on developing a source
attribution model for human campylobacteriosis cases in the
Manawatu. I have also had two summer research projects: one developing a
deterministic SIR model for leptospirosis in sheep which linked to
leptospirosis incidence in abattoir workers, and the other
investigating a novel method for assessing the goodness of fit of
stochastic SIR epidemic models.
</p><p>
My PhD project will focus on developing methods for spatio-temporal
epidemic modelling. The methods we develop will be applied to
Leptospirosis data from Salvador, Brazil.
</p><p>
My studies are financially supported by a full time research
studentship at the overseas level, based on the Health e-Research
Centre (HeRC) funded by the Medical Research Council (MRC), UK.
