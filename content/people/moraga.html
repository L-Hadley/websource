<p>
I am a Senior Research Associate in Spatial Statistics and
Epidemiology. My research focuses on spatial and spatio-temporal
statistics and their applications to health
surveillance. Specifically, I develop, implement and apply statistical
models and methods to explore the spatial and temporal patterns of
disease, determine their association with potential risk factors, and
allow rapid detection of outbreaks.

<p>
I received my Bachelor's degree in Mathematics and my Doctorate degree
in Statistics from the University of Valencia, and my Masterâ€™s degree
in Biostatistics from Harvard University.
