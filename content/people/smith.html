<p>
I work in the areas of spatial epidemiology and computation for Bayesian methods.
I am interested in methods for spatio-temporal data, small area estimation, and
issues related to combining multiple data sources in a joint analysis.  I am
currently working on spatio-temporal modeling of cancer incidence in the state
of Washington (USA) and on the spatio-temporal epidemiology of Campylobacter in the UK.
