<p>
I am a PhD student in Statistics at the Department of Statistical
Sciences of the University of Padova (Italy) and I am currently a
visiting student in CHICAS (Lancaster Medical School) supervised by
Prof. Peter J. Diggle.
</p>
<p>
 My main research topic is Spatial Statisics. I am investigating the
effects of positional errors on geostatistical models. My interests
fall also in other fields such as Statistical Learning and
Biostatistics.
</p>
 
<p>
I obtained my B.Sc. in Economics and my M.Sc. in Finance from the
University of Trento (Italy). For my master project I have conducted a
spatio-temporal analysis of crimes in the municipality of Trento.

<p> 
I love programming in R and I have recently published 
<a href="http://www.fiftyshadesofr.com/">a blog about
applied statistics with R</a>
