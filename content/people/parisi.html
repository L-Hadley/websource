Andrea is a Senior Research Associate in Infectious Disease Modelling
with extended experience in computer simulations. His research
activity is focussed on the study of the geographical spread of human
infectious diseases and viral evolution dynamics. At Lancaster, he is
developing mathematical models of human seasonal influenza evolution,
as part of an EPSRC-funded <a href = "https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematical-sciences/research/centre-for-mathematics-in-healthcare/">Centre for Mathematics in Healthcare</a>
</p>
<p>
His
work is in collaboration with Jonathan Read (CHICAS, Lancaster) 
and <a href="https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/mathematical-sciences/staff/kieran-sharkey/">Kieran Sharkey (University of Liverpool)</a>
and the models will explore how immunity to seasonal flu strains
accumulates in populations and how the patterning of contributes to
the evolution and emergence of novel strains.
