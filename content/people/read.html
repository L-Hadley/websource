<p>
Jon's research is focused on understanding the transmission of
infectious diseases of both humans and animals, with the aim of
developing better predictive models with which to inform infection
control strategies and policies. This involves a mixture of
epidemiological field work, secondary data analysis and mathematical
and tactical modelling. A major part of this research is understanding
the structure of human social networks and identifying risk factors
for transmission of infectious diseases. To this end he is at the
leading edge of developing new quantification methods and
characterising human contact patterns, and developing realistic
network models of contagious processes.
</p>
<p>
He is interested in the evolutionary dynamics of infectious diseases,
the sociological and ecological processes that drive evolution, and
how these processes and their emergent properties may be exploited for
disease control and eradication.  His research encompasses
pneumococcal infection, rotavirus, norovirus, Ebola, MER-CoV, seasonal
and pandemic influenza, and other respiratory viruses.

Collaborative projects include the <a href="http://iddynamics.jhsph.edu/fluscape.html">FluScape</a> influenza cohort in
Southern China, and the <a href="http://smart.pitt.edu/">SMART</a> study of
influenza in schools in Pittsburgh USA. Jon has research and advisory
links to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/public-health-england">Public Health England</a>,
the <a href="http://www.cdc.gov/">Centers for Disease Control and Prevention</a> and
the <a href="http://www.state.gov/">US State Department</a>.

Jon is slowly trying to regain his past ability to climb rocks of a moderate standard, and welcomes all attempts to get him to tie into a rope. He dabbles in photography too.
