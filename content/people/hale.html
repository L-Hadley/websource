Recently I have moved to the CHICAS group in the Lancaster Medical School -
my background is in theoretical physics.  My current research
interests include developing statistical models and software for
real-time surveillance of routinely recorded diseases in the
veterinary sector.  In addition, I have an interest in developing
statistical models and software for estimating disease risk of a
population travelling through a geographical region in which there are
small pockets of pollution posing a health risk; the population are
tracked by global positioning systems (GPS).
