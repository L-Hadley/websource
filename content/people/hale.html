As an MRC Research Fellow I work at the interface of biostatistics and
informatics in CHICAS at the Lancaster Medical School.  My fellowship
research revolves around using routinely collected NHS patient data
(from the population of Salford, UK) to investigate the health
landscape of a population in both space and time. My work also
involves developing statistical models and software for real-time
surveillance of routinely recorded diseases in the veterinary sector.
I have developed statistical models and software for estimating
disease risk of a population, tracked by GPS, travelling through a
geographical region.
