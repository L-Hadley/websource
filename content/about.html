<h2>Who are we?</h2>
<p>
CHICAS is a group of staff, research associates, and postgraduate students in the 
Lancaster Medical School, part of the Faculty of Health and Medicine at 
Lancaster University.
</p>
<h2>What do we do?</h2>
<p>
Our main research focus is on the development and application of novel statistical and 
epidemiological methods. We work on spatial and longitudinal aspects of statistics,
and increasingly in spatio-temporal models.
</p>
<h2>Where do we apply this?</h2>
<p>
Our work has involved national and international partners, and has had impact
across the globe. We have a special interest in the epidemiology of disease
in developing countries. See our <a href="map.html">map</a> for more info.
</p>
<h2>Interesting Links</h2>
<p>
We have a set of <a href="spatialepi.html">external links</a> of interesting
spatial epidemiology applications and disease maps produced by other groups.
