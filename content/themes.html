<h2>Geospatial statistics</h2>
<p>
The geospatial statistics theme covers the development of statistical methodology
motivated by and applied to problems in population health research where the locations
of health outcomes in geographical space play an important role in their interpretation.
The group works in both developed and developing country settings, but has a global
health focus that is pursued through strong collaborative links with low and middle
income countries in Africa, South America and southern Asia.
</p>
<h2>Routinely collected health data</h2>
<p>
Routinely collected data from the NHS can be used to answer many research questions.
Projects within the group cover a range of areas including epidemiology, diagnostic
accuracy and health service improvement. We apply existing methods as well as
developing new ones with a number of clinical foci including Neurology, Respiratory and
Mental Health Services as well as Care Homes. The CHICAS group works with a number
of NHS trusts on research projects and in addition to that locally we provide support for
NHS data science projects and groups. We also collaborate with the Office for Health
Improvement and Disparities (OHID), the Integrated Care System and Public Health
services within the local government.
</p>
<h2>Infectious disease modelling</h2>
<p>
Infectious diseases have health and economic impacts for both humans and livestock.
The CHICAS group works with partners in low-, middle- and high-income countries to
better understand the epidemiology of infectious diseases, and how and where they
transmit. We develop statistical methodology and generate scientific insights to provide
timely information and understanding of epidemics to inform their control and
eradication. Our projects include a range of applications (including SARS-CoV-2,
influenza and foot-and-mouth) with national and international academic and
public/animal health partners including Public Health England, the Department of Health
and Social care, the Centre for Disease Control and the World Health Organization.
