Special coffee break is <strong>Thursdays</strong>
when <strong>cake</strong> is provided and everyone is encouraged to make a special effort
to turn up.

<h4>Friday Evening</h4>

At around 5pm on Friday, there may be a trip to Fylde Bar downstairs
for a drink before the weekend. They serve alcoholic and non-alcoholic 
drinks as well as teas and coffees.
